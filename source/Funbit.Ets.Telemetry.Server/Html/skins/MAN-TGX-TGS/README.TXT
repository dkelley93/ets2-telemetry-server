remade this MAN TGX skin for the telemetry.

added new realistic warning signs (THESE ARE IN DUTCH, since i used the dutch manual for the warnings)
added a warning. SHIFT NEUTRAL. if the gear isn't in neutral and you start the electricity you would get that error.
added more dashboard lights aswell as the icons that light up when the turning the electricity on
resized the skin to make it larger so everthing is a bit more clear on a tablet
relocated the symbols to the real places on the dashboard
removed info that isn't displayed on the real dashboard
overal it is simply the real dashboard as you would find it in a real MAN TGX (i drive MAN for a living so i know what is displayed)

spended more than a week remaking this skin. so allot of time is spend into this. hope you will like it
